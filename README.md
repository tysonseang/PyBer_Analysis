## Results

As seen in the DataFrame below, Ride-sharing data varies widely across the three city types analysed. Among the city types, rural locations saw the lowest number of rides, drivers, and total fares. This resulted in the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver. The inverse is true for ride-shares in urban cities, which saw 13x as many rides, more than 30x as many drivers, and 9x the toal fares. The average fare per ride was roughly $10 lower while the average fare per driver was nearly $40 lower.

Weekly total fares analyzed from January to April 2019 indicate that the total number of urban fares outpaced suburban fares week-over-week. Likewise, suburban fares outpaced total fares in rural cities each week during the time period.
